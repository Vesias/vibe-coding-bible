# Implement GitFlow workflow
git flow init
git flow feature start user-authentication
# ... develop feature ...
git flow feature publish user-authentication
git flow feature finish user-authentication

git apply 0001-feature-patch.patch

# Use git bisect to find bugs
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0.0
# Git will checkout commits to test

# Stash management
git stash push -m "WIP: user profile feature"
git stash list
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

**Level 5: Git Hooks and Automation (5 minutes)**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Run linting and tests before commit

echo "Running pre-commit checks..."

# Run linter
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."

```
Team can't agree on testing framework:
- 40% want Jest (familiar but limited)
- 40% want Vitest (new but better performance)  
- 20% want Cypress only (comprehensive but slow)

Need to choose one and commit
Training time will impact sprint velocity
Wrong choice could slow down future development
```

**Unit Economics Calculation (5 minutes)**

```
SaaS Metrics Calculation:

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
Sales & Marketing Spend: $50,000/month
New Customers Acquired: 500/month
CAC = $50,000 √∑ 500 = $100

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):
Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $85/month
Gross Margin: 85%
Monthly Churn Rate: 3%
LTV = ($85 √ó 0.85) √∑ 0.03 = $2,408

LTV:CAC Ratio: $2,408 √∑ $100 = 24:1 ‚úì (Target: >3:1)

Payback Period:
CAC √∑ (ARPU √ó Gross Margin) = $100 √∑ ($85 √ó 0.85) = 1.4 months ‚úì (Target: <12 months)
```

**Financial Projections (5 minutes)**

```
12-Month Financial Model:

Month 1:
- New Customers: 100
- MRR: $8,500
- Churn: 0% (new customers)
- Net MRR: $8,500

Month 6:
- New Customers: 400
- New MRR: $34,000
- Existing MRR: $156,000
- Churn: $12,000
- Net MRR: $178,000

Month 12:
- New Customers: 800
- New MRR: $68,000
- Existing MRR: $487,000
- Churn: $28,000
- Net MRR: $527,000

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $6,324,000
Growth Rate: 62% month-over-month average
```

**Scenario Planning:**
```
Conservative Scenario (70% of projections):
- ARR: $4.4M
- Team size: 15 people
- Burn rate: $180K/month
- Runway: 18 months

Optimistic Scenario (130% of projections):
- ARR: $8.2M  
- Team size: 25 people
- Burn rate: $350K/month
- Profitability: Month 14
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Calculate accurate unit economics
- Build 12-month financial model
- Create scenario planning for different growth rates
- Identify key metrics to track and optimize
